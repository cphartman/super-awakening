## Technical Background
The `Super Game Boy` system exposes up to [4 controller inputs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Joypad_Input.html#usage-in-sgb-software) for `Game Boy` games.  This feature enables local multiplayer for `Game Boy` games.

| ![Street Fighter 2](./docs/super-awakening/streetfighter2_sgb_enhanced.png) | ![Bomberman](./docs/super-awakening/bombermap_sgb_enhanced.png) |

The `Super Game Boy` forwards button inputs from the `Super Nintendo` to button inputs on the `Game Boy`.  The `Game Boy` controller can only support 8 buttons.  As a result, the additional `X/Y/R/L` buttons on the `Super Nintendo` controller are not sent to the `Game Boy`.

The romhack instructs the `Super Game Boy` to send the controller 1 `X/Y/R/L` buttons to the `Game Boy` controller 2 as `A/B/Left/Right` buttons.  This allow a single `Super Nintendo` controller to send all 12 button inputs to the `Game Boy`.  The romhack implements custom functionality for the additional controller inputs.

## System Compatibility
The romhack is fully supported on an original `Super Nintendo` system using a `Super Game Boy`.  `Game Boy Color` is supported in emulators where available.  Some emulators require additional configurations to set the `X/Y/R/L` buttons to controller 2.

| Super Nintendo | ‚úÖ |  `SuperNt`+`SGB1`+`EverDrive-GBx7` |
